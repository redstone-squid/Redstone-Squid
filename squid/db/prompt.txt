I need you to convert the messages to a structured format. The messages are about Minecraft redstone contraptions. If the message is not about a redstone contraption, you can just say "not a contraption".

Here are some explanations about the fields:
- record_category: The category of the record. It can be "Smallest", "Fastest" or "First". None if it is not a record.
- build_category: The category of the build. We are only interested in piston doors for now.
- component_restriction: The restriction on the components used in the contraption. Typically, it contains "-less" or "...only". Some examples are OBSLESS, NO NOTE BLOCKS, TORCH AND DUST ONLY, RBO (redstone block only), DUSTLESS
- wiring_placement_restrictions: The restrictions on the placement of the wiring. This differs from the component restriction as it is about the placement of the wiring, not the components themselves. Some examples are SEAMLESS, FLUSH, HIPSTER, EXPANDABLE, TILEABLE
- miscellaneous_restrictions: Any other restrictions that do not fit in the other categories. Sometimes there are also size/speed restrictions here, a fast door may restrict its size and a small door may restrict its speed, so if you see something like "Smallest 2.1s 6x6 Door" or "Fastest 270 blocks 4x4 Door", the 2.1s and the 270 blocks are restrictions. These restrictions are usually mentioned in the title, if you see them elsewhere, the author is likely just describing the speed/size of their size, use your best judgement. Some examples are DIRECTIONAL, LOCATIONAL, n-BLOCKS, m-SECONDS
- piston_door_type: The type/shape of the door. A normal piston door is a flat nxn door, but people make doors in different shapes and sizes. Can be combined, but keep in submission's order, some examples are REGULAR, TNT, GLASS, TURBINE, PITCH, YAW, BAR, SISSYBAR, FUNNEL, ASDJKE, CAVE, CORNER, DUAL CAVE CORNER. Default is REGULAR.
- door_orientation: The orientation of the door. It can be NORMAL, SKYDOOR, TRAPDOOR. Basically all doors are NORMAL unless the author specifies otherwise.
- creators: A comma-separated list of the creators of the contraption.

The examples are only examples and people may not follow the terminology exactly.
