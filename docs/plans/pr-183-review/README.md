# PR #183 review follow-up plans

## Scope

This directory organizes the review comments made by `Glinte` on
[PR #183](https://github.com/redstone-squid/Redstone-Squid/pull/183), using each inline comment's
original commit anchor to enforce the cutoff at `5edfd3e`.

- 184 comments are in scope across 86 files.
- All 184 threads remain open on GitHub; 33 are marked outdated and 151 still have current anchors.
- Starboard paths and behavior are excluded. Shared reaction routing remains in scope because it
  serves non-starboard consumers.
- The later comment on the legacy `/verify` endpoint is excluded because its original commit is
  after `5edfd3e`.
- Each plan audits current HEAD so later fixes are credited rather than accidentally reverted.

The broad review clusters were: submission UX (42 comments), voting (34), schematics (33),
API/auth/sync (25), runtime/observability (18), identity/permissions (14), tests/tooling (10), and
shared reaction routing (8).

## Plans

1. [Consent and verification UX](01-consent-verification-ux.md)
2. [User identity and persistence](02-user-identity-persistence.md)
3. [Submission UI architecture](03-submission-ui-architecture.md)
4. [Submission behavior and recovery](04-submission-behavior-recovery.md)
5. [Multi-attachment semantics](05-multi-attachment-semantics.md)
6. [Schematic domain contracts and upload safety](06-schematic-domain-upload-safety.md)
7. [Nucleation adapter, wire, and worker hardening](07-nucleation-adapter-worker-hardening.md)
8. [Schematic rendering and simulation](08-schematic-rendering-simulation.md)
9. [Voting redesign](09-voting-redesign.md)
10. [Shared reaction routing](10-shared-reaction-routing.md)
11. [API, auth, records, and sync](11-api-auth-records-sync.md)
12. [Runtime and observability](12-runtime-observability.md)
13. [Test and tooling cleanup](13-test-tooling-cleanup.md) —
    [thread dispositions](13-test-tooling-dispositions.md)

## Suggested sequence

1. Settle provider-neutral identity and shared value types in plans 2, 6, and 11.
2. Implement the submission contracts and UX in plans 1 and 3–5.
3. Harden the schematic boundary before changing orchestration in plans 7 and 8.
4. Redesign voting contracts before simplifying reaction routing in plans 9 and 10.
5. Handle runtime/observability decisions in plan 12, then perform the test cleanup in plan 13
   alongside or immediately after the affected implementation plan.

Treat each numbered plan as a separate planning and implementation unit. Before closing GitHub
threads, produce a thread-level checklist that records one of four dispositions: fixed by the new
work, already fixed after `5edfd3e`, retained with rationale, or deferred to a named follow-up.
GitHub replies and thread resolution require separate explicit authorization.

## Delivery convention

- Commit each coherent implementation milestone independently using component-scoped imperative
  subjects.
- Run the smallest focused tests while developing, then changed-file formatting/type checks,
  `git diff --check`, and `alembic heads` when persistence is touched.
- Recheck Nucleation documentation and reproduce behavior on a clean pinned install before filing
  or retaining an upstream workaround.
